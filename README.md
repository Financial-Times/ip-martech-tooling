# Martech tooling

This repo contains different shareable tooling and other pieces of common code or similar for Martech engineers.
Currently, there is a team-wide `eslint-config` available on the `eslint-config-martech` branch. The `main` branch is an orphaned branch, so contains different content from our `eslint`-related branch.

The main branch also contains useful scripts.

## Branches

The idea is that we can create orphan branches for use as `npm` packages, so we consolidate and can easily share common tooling for our different repos and projects.

Currently, we only have one other branch of interest:
- `eslint-config-martech`
